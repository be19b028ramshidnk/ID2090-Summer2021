Newton's Second Law of Motion


Newton's second law of motion pertains to the behavior of objects for which all existing forces are not balanced. The second law states that the acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object. 


   F = M A 


WHERE F IS FORCE ACTING ON THE BODY AND M IS THE MASS OF THE BODY AND A IS THE ACCELERATION
